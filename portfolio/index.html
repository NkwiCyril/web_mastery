        <div class="about-me">
          <p>
            I am currently a Frontend developer who likes playing around with UI and UX design as far as the web is concerned.
            <br><br>
            I have been writing code for over <span class="yellow">2+</span> years since I enrolled into the Faculty of Engineering and Tech to become a software engineer. If you look around you'll see the programming languages I have experience in with my main language being the largest.
            <br><br>
            I like playing soccer during my leisure time and video games as well.
